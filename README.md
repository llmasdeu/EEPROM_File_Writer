# EEPROM_File_Writer

This application, coded in Java, is used to write EEPROM .hex files.

The program handles the introduction of the different cells where its value must be set, and translates them into hexadecimal files, following the format required by the EEPROM. Finally, the system handles the task of computing the checksum required to make it work correctly.

This application has been developed to work with 27C256 EEPROM models.
